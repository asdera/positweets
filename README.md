### :sparkles: Welcome to our Hack the North project! :sparkles: 
We're a team of 4 students :nerd_face: &nbsp; from the University of Waterloo. We came up with PosiTweets during a 
heated discussion about how exhausted we are of seeing negative news. We created this app for people like us who 
want to take some time before bed to enjoy some positive Twitter content! We hope to expand our app for Instagram,
Facebook, and other social media apps by user request!

### our stack :computer:
React.js, Flask, Twitter API


### how to use PosiTweets
login, refresh, and poof! all of your followers tweets will be filtered using a sentiment analysis algorithm to show you only the positive ones :grin:
